🎵 Simple Search Engine for Songs

A Flask-based Search Engine that allows users to search for songs using lyrics snippets! This project demonstrates how to implement a basic text search functionality with TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for ranking results.

🚀 Features

    🔍 Search Functionality: Enter a phrase or a snippet of lyrics to find matching songs.
    📊 TF-IDF Vectorization: Efficient text representation for accurate matching.
    🧠 Cosine Similarity: Ranks search results based on relevance.
    🎨 User-Friendly Interface: A simple and responsive web design built with Flask and CSS.
    🌐 Deployable: Ready for deployment on platforms like Render, Railway, or Heroku.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Backend: Flask (Python)
    Text Processing: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity)
    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
    Deployment: Render / Railway / Heroku

📝 How It Works

    The dataset (songdata.csv) is loaded and preprocessed.
    Lyrics are transformed into vectors using TF-IDF.
    User queries are vectorized and compared with the dataset using Cosine Similarity.
    Results are ranked by relevance and displayed to the user.
